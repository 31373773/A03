Welcome to GitHub. It is coding platform that makes it easier to collaborate with other coders on the same project. This way, everyone can work on the same project all while in different locations. Git is different because it's a tool for managing your source code history. If you want to check out a project from a remote host, a distant location from which data are retrieved, WebStorm allows you to transfer data from an existing project and create a new project based on the data you've downloaded. This new project with the same data from another project is called a CLONE.

1) You need to create something called a repository and this is where your single project will be stored. Everyone working on this single project can acess and create anything your project needs, at any given time, from different machines. 

2) Create a Branch. Remember that if different people are working on the same project, each person will contribute different things to the project. Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. Every time you save changes, they are called COMMITS. These "versions" or changes are associated with messages the author left behind. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner to add these commits. The original form of this project is called a MASTER COPY. You will need to call FETCH if you are looking for the latest history of changes.

3) Okay, now you have a repository and are semi-comfortable with the lingo. When you want to  have someone review your work, you can open an pull request. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. This makes it very easy to get second opinions on your project without getting mixed up with your own. Look over your changes on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit. Each contributor can work alone on their own computers, but upload or PUSH changes up to the GitHub repository when they’re ready. 

4) Once you are happy with the changes made, click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master. This overrides that original copy you had and replaces it with this collaborated version. Normally when Git merges, all the commits are resolved, but merge conflicts do happen when you merge branches that have competing commits. In that case, you must manually  decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
